Quick n' dirty list of tasks:

* Redo person schema to make per-service data refresh possible.
* Add a plugin interface to the backend to support "accelerators",
  little bundles that would describe fields to be indexed in separate
  tables, and what fields they map to in .find().  Only accelerated
  fields will be accesible via .find().
* Have the backend know about specific doc schemas (e.g., Portable
  Contacts).  Probably tied to accelerators impl.
* Complete vcard support (lacks multiline field support & other more
  obscure fields)
* Split vcard from gmail, so that we can easily support other vcard
  sources.
* Add a post-processing layer, probably glued using notifications.
* Use post-processing layer to optionally generate gravatar image
  URLs.
