<p><b>Development Notes:</b></p>

<p>
<ul>
<li>Support for Yahoo! import.  You will need to log in and retrieve a security code from Yahoo! to enable the importer.</li>

<li>Support for Facebook import and discovery.  When you connect to Facebook you will need to authorize Firefox Contacts to access your account.</li>

<li>Support for "person:" addresses, and auto-completion of people in the AwesomeBar.  Just start typing a contact's name in the location bar and it will automatically suggest completions.</li>

<li>Much-enhanced people search capabilities.  The installed discovery modules will run automatically when you view a contact. 
 Discovery modules for Webfinger, HCard import, Google Social Graph, Facebook, Gravatar, Yelp, Amazon, and Flickr are included.</li>

<li>Automatic combination of data discovered through discovery.  Firefox will load "profile pages" that it finds and combine 
their information into the contact.  Because it is being run on the client, Firefox can access protected pages that are not
visible to web-crawler-type systems; for example, it can access a Gowalla location trace from a friend, or a Facebook birthday,
 because it is already logged in as you.  Note that this only works with sites that support standard automatic discovery 
 mechanisms like HCard, RSS, and ActivityStreams.</li>

<li>Support for non-contact people in the AwesomeBar.  You may enter "person:xxx", where xxx is any email address or URL, 
and Firefox will do what it can to display information about that person.  Information from your local address book (if any) 
will be combined with information that can be discovered from sources on the web.  You can use URLs from social networking 
sites like Facebook, Twitter, Digg -- for example, try "<a href="person:http://www.facebook.com/zuck">person:http://www.facebook.com/zuck</a>"</li>

</ul>
